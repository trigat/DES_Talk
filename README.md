# DES Talk
Python script that simplifies DESFire communications with the [Proxmark3](https://github.com/RfidResearchGroup/proxmark3) RFID tool.

# Overview
This tool simplifies the creation and deletion of DESFire applications and files. It supports USB, Bluetooth, and Termux connections and has been tested on Android and Linux. More functionality will be added in the future.

This enables you to read and write to DESFire EV1, EV2, and EV3 cards, as well as Dangerous Things implants like the XDF2 and flexDF2.
